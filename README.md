# INSTALLATION & DOWNLOAD

This is a sketch library, as described [here]https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries.

Checkout the project into your arduino "Libraries" folder.
On Mac with OSX, do: 
'''git clone https://github.com/brederle/nanodcc.git ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/'''
On Windows, from your home directory, do: 
'''git clone https://github.com/brederle/nanodcc.git "My Documents\Arduino\libraries\"'''

You can now include the different headers of the library into your own projects.
The project is not in the official Arduino library administration (yet).

If siccessful, different decoders should be available as examples in Arduino Studio as
starting point for your own personal decoder build.
